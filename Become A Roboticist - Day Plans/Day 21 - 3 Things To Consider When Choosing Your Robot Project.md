It's finally time to choose your robot. But how should you pick one? What should you build? 

## Don't Do Research And Development Yet! 

When beginners think about the robot they want to build, its easy to imagine a highly complex robot that does some extreme R&D task. Perhaps it has an experimental sensor and extremely complex manipulation to do some in-home task. I'd caution you against trying to build a complex robot on your first attempt. 

Instead of being novel, look for robots that already exist and solve important problems. By creating simulations of these robots we will avoid the risk that we attempt to build something that is impossible, or worse, uneconomic. If a robot already exists then it should already have a group of people that it helps in a tangible way. Simulating robots like that is much easier to talk about, and are more instructive as they help us understand what is possible. 

When you've mastered building basic robots, then you can go on to building the robot of your dreams. 

## Action steps 

1. Look through the 3 robots similar to Krytn and the 3 robots similar to MACI that you have found so far and add them to your list. 
2. If you've seen other interesting robots, also feel free to add them to your list.
3. Make sure you can answer for each robot: 
	1. Who does it help? 
	2. How does it help? 
	3. What environment does it work in? 
	4. What is its simplest configuration (i.e. what is the minimum number of links and joints for it to do its job). 
4. Sort them from simple to complex. Now pick your favourite. I'd recommend picking the simplest robot. 

##  I already have the answers, I don't need to do this again

Over the past 21 days you've learnt alot about robotics, and learnt what you are capable of. Now you're about to build your own robot you should look back at your previous notes to make sure this is the robot you want to do. 

This final write up is you committing to the rest of the world that you will be building this robot simulation. So make sure it is the one you want.
