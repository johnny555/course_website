Congratulations! You've successfully built a robot arm and simulated it in Gazebo. But what about the robot you are going to build? Today its time to go exploring for robots with manipulators. 

Feel free to include robots with wheeled bases, but try to find 3 robot arms doing useful tasks in the wild. 

# Don't Forget The Most Important Thing

Beginner roboticist can often be so enamoured by the robot that they made, that they forget one important thing - who does it help! When we are thinking about building a robot, we need to consider the context that the robot will be in (its environment) and the job it needs to do. These jobs are always ultimately helping someone. So rather than just building a robot because it is cool, we need to consider who the robot is actually helping. This will also make it much easier to talk about our robot to our friends, family and randoms on the internet. 

## Action steps 

1. Search for robot arms on LinkedIn & X
2. Look through your history to find robots that you have liked. 
3. Look through company listings of robotics companies, http://roboausnet.com  has a list of robotics companies in Australia. 
4. For each robot you like answer: 
	1. Who does it help? 
	2. How does it help them? 
	3. What environment is it in? 

##  Simplify!

You might be tempted by robot hand manipulation robots. But before you decide to try and build a hand like gripper, I suggest you think about the problem. Does the task really need a hand? Could you get away with a 2 finger gripper instead? Could you build a custom gripper? Could the parts that need fingers be automated some other way? (i.e. with electronics to push buttons instead of fingers)?

# Wait, haven't we already done this? 

Yes, we did the same exercise for wheeled robots. It's important to consider armed robots, so we are doing the same thing here.
