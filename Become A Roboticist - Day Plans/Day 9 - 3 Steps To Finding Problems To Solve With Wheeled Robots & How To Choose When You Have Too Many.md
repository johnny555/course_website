Congratulations! You have built an autonomous robot and modified it with a link. This robot drives around the Gamecity coffee shop and delivers coffee. But what about the robot YOU are going to build? Today we will take a step back and reflect on our robot and think about our future robot. 

The aim will be to find robots that are similar to Krytn (a wheeled robot platform). Feel free to branch out beyond the differential drive that Krytn uses, and broaden your search to any wheeled robot base. 
## Don't Forget The Most Important Thing

Beginner roboticist can often be so enamoured by the robot that they made, that they forget one important thing - who does it help! When we are thinking about building a robot, we need to consider the context that the robot will be in (its environment) and the job it needs to do. These jobs are always ultimately helping someone. So rather than just building a robot because it is cool, we need to consider who the robot is actually helping. This will also make it much easier to talk about our robot to our friends, family and randoms on the internet. 

## Action steps 

1. Search for wheeled robot on linkedin & X
2. Look through your history to find robots that you have liked. 
3. Look through company listings of robotics companies, http://roboausnet.com  has a list of robotics companies in Australia. 
4. For each robot you like answer: 
	1. Who does it help? 
	2. How does it help them? 
	3. What environment is it in? 

# Legged Robots?

At this point, most students want to talk about using legged robots. For this course we are avoiding legged robots due to their complexity. We often find that we can modify the environment a robot will operate in and use that to avoid the complexity of adding legs.
