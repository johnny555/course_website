Welcome to Day 5 of start creating robots. 

So far we have: 

- Created an autonomous driving robot 
- Controlled a robot arm 
- Built our own robot in CAD 

Today we are going to put the finishing touches on our simulations. Robots that don't exist in a world are not very useful, so we need to add things to the world to make it more realistic. So far we have added simple cubes, but we can add much more interesting things. 

# Spin up the system 

- Open a terminal and run the command:  `docker run -p 6080:80 johnny555/scr:v2`
- Open a web browser: http://localhost:6080/vnc.html 



# Run the Empty world task 

Now that VS Code is running in a dev container. Turn on the simulation by running `Ctr+Shift+P` -> "Run Task" -> "Empty world with your robot ".

Now go to a web browser, type http://localhost:8080/vnc.html and hit connect. 

You should see a few screens, you can right click on the task bar at the bottom to maximise some of the windows. 

# Gazebo

Now we can use the Gazebo plugins to add stuff to our world. Click on the three dots in the top right and select "Resource Spawner". You'll see a new window appear in the bottom right. Search through and start populating your world!  Just click the cloud icon to download a model, and then click it again and click in the world to place it. 

You can also visit https://app.gazebosim.org to find models and search them more easily. 

# Congratulations! 

You've successfully finished the start creating robots challenge. Now you know how to create robots, what will you do next? 

## Post your wins 

I'm a big believer in showing your work online. If you got the robot working, post about it on Social media such as X or LinkedIn and tag me. I'd love to see how you went, and you'll be surprised who you can meet online once you start talking about robotics!
