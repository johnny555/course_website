It's time to build your first robot. To make it easy for you, lets play with a FreeCAD template that you can build upon to build out a diffdrive robot. 

## But I want to use some other CAD software! 

FreeCAD is not without its bugs and flaws, and this makes new users nervous to use it. In this lesson I'm giving you a simple template that's already setup, this should make it faster and easier for you to create your own robot. However, if you really want to do it from scratch, you are free to do so. 

The big pitfall with setting it up yourself is going to be moving the mesh files and writing your own URDF/XACRO. If you are comfortable with that, then give it a go! 

## Action steps 

1. Open FreeCAD, first robot template. 
2. Modify the robot base link slightly (i.e. add a sketch to a face and extrude something). 
3. Export it to urdf. 
4. Run the "First robot freecad task" 
5. Drive your differential drive robot around. 

##  Is This Too Easy? 

Ambitious beginner roboticists might feel like building a wheeled robot is too easy. If this is you, I'd recommend trying to build this one robot from scratch first. When you've mastered how to build a simple diff drive robot, you can move on to adding robot arms for a robot manipulator.
