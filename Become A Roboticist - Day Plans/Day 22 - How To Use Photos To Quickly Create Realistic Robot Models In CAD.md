It's time to start sketching your robots links. 

# But My Model Won't Be Exactly The Same As The Photo

Don't worry too much about accuracy. You just want to capture the general shape of each part of your robot. 

## Pay attention to your origins

Also, when your building links that rotate, consider where the axis of rotation needs to be. Ideally it should always rotate about its origin. It's also nicer to keep your base_link centred. You can use the FreeCAD cross tools to move the links where they need to be when its time to assemble your robot. 

## Action steps 

1. Get 2 pictures of your robot. One on the side and one on the front. 
2. Open the First Robot template (or make start from scratch)
3. Import the phots into freecad (File -> Import) . 
4. Build out each link as a separate part/body (or use the parts/body in the template). Don't forget you can visually hide the other bodies when your not working on them by hitting spacebar. 
5. Modify the CROSS robot template or create a new one and add the links. 
6. Add the links as real, visual and collision objects. 
7. Add and configure joints
8. Use the placement button to move the joint origins around to get the robot to have the correct structure. 

##  I'm Not An Artist And Therefore My Robot Will Look Bad !

Many beginners hesitate to make their own creation because they are worried it won't be perfect first time. 

But one of the secrets to creating anything is to be ok with a rough first draft. 

Even though your robot might be made from just a few pads and pockets off 2D sketches, you will be surprised how easily people seeing your robot will understand what its supposed to be. We will also take the time in a few days to make it look nicer, so don't stress right now. 

Be ok with a rough looking first draft, you will be able to make it look better later.
