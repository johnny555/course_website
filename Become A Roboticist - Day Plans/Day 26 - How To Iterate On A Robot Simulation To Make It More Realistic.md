It's time to refine our simulation. 
We're going to look at improving the fidelity of our sketches and making our models look better. We will also use blender to make things look nice. 

## Action steps 

1. Go and look back at the photos of the robot. 
2. Find extra details to add to the FreeCAD models, perhaps its a better shape? Perhaps its chamfered edges or extra detail.
3. Add this detail and re-export. 
4. When you are sure your shapes are finished, use blender to paint the meshes. 
5. Look at your gazebo environment. Was there something that you wish existed but you couldn't find in the resources spawner? 
6. Create a new FreeCAD document, and build an object you want to spawn into the world.
