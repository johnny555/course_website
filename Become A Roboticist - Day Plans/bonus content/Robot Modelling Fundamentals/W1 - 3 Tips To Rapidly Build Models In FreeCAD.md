# Tip 1: Imagine The Shapes Profile

Think about the shape from different angles. Identify what is the angle that the shape's profile is the simplest, identify angles that the shapes profile shows important features.

In the cup example: The bottom shows a circle for its main cylinder shape. The side profile gives good view of how the handle is shaped.

# Tip 2: Think In Terms Of Pad and Pocket

When creating FreeCAD models, think in terms of adding or removing material with sketches. You can use the Pad tool to add material, and the pocket tool to remove material. There are also advanced helper tools like thickness that will make removing material easy if you just want to create a hollow container.

In the Cup example, we used pad to create the broad shapes of the cup body and the handle, while we used thickness and pocket to cut out of that shape what we needed.

# Tip 3: Keep The Number Of Steps Low

FreeCAD can become unstable if you have lots of steps. Try to minimise the number of steps that you use.

# Bonus Tip: Explore Advanced tools.

Tools like the polar pattern can be very helpful for making repeating patterns. Experiment with the advanced tools of FreeCAD sketcher.
