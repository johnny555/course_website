# Publishing On Social Media Like LinkedIN or X

In this challenge I'll be asking you to publish on LinkedIn or some other social media alot. This can be abit daunting for people who haven't done this before. So in this video I'll walk you through how I like to think about publishing my robotics work.

# Why Publish?

If you want to become a roboticist, other people need to know that you are a roboticist. The easiest way to do that is to start talking about robotics on social media like LinkedIn or X. This will:

- Help you become known beyond your team at work
    
- Attract people who are interested in robotics to you.
    
- Help you to get involved in more robotics related projects.
    

# How To Publish?

If you are already a pro at publishing on the internet, feel free to skip this. This is how I like to publish, but there are plenty of other ways to do it as well.

The thing I like to keep in mind is that I am writing for a single, specific person. If you can imagine yourself telling someone (that you might actually know in real life) about what you are talking about, then that is the kind of stuff you want to share. So think about a single person, and answer for yourself:

_Why should they care?_Â (What about what you are saying is important to them)

It's also helpful to give them a name, such as "Masters Students in Robotics", if that a category for the specific person you are trying to reach.

## List 1-3 Things

Now you have decided who you are going to write to, and why they should care, you can structure your information as a list. Choose to tell them 1-3 things, perhaps mistakes, tips or reasons. But structure your content as a list of things to help someone else.

# 3 Things To Avoid

It's hard to go wrong, but for beginners here are 3 things you should avoid:

- Don't use ChatGPT. Instead just write how you speak, even if your English isn't very good. It will be more authentic if you write like you are talking to a friend.
    
- Don't worry about hashtags. They are for the internet in an age when text was hard for computers to understand.
    
- Don't worry about gaming the system. It doesn't matter when you post, or what sort of thing you post. Just post your progress in a way that helps someone.
